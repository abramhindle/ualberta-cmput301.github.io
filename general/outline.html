<h3 id="course-content">Course Content</h3>
<h4 id="course-description">Course Description</h4>
<p>As an introduction to software engineering, this course is about building software effectively. You will apply good practices, effective design techniques, and development tools within a team project to create an application with a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>The focus is largely practical, with broad coverage in topics such as: object-oriented design, user interfaces, unit testing, design patterns, and refactoring.</p>
<p>Communication skills, team dynamics, working with a "customer", and creativity are also important factors in the course project. The knowledge, skills, and experience you gain will be invaluable in your future software development projects.</p>
<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>CMPUT 201 or CMPUT 275</p>
<h4 id="objectives-and-learning-outcomes">Objectives and Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>We will learn about applying software engineering concepts to design and implement interactive applications.</p>
<p>One effective way to build such applications is to apply object-oriented design and use software components. To be useful to end users, the design of these applications must also be guided by usability principles. The course involves a team project in building a well-designed Java/Android application with a sophisticated graphical user interface.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will have a strong background in basic software engineering concepts. Also, you will have the skills to implement interactive applications in Android. You will learn to propose and think critically about software and user interface designs.</p>
<p>Students are expected to participate in all classes and labs.</p>

<h4 id="statement-of-expectations-for-ai-use">Statement of Expectations for AI Use</h4>
<p><strong>You MUST not submit work by LLMs as your own, that is plagiarism.</strong> This also applies to other "AI" and Generative Models: ChatGPT, Lex.page, DALL-E2, Google BARD/Gemini, Microsoft Bing/Copilot, and others. If you use LLMs you must cite it. This includes the corporation that made the AI, the AI, Subject, and Date. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// The following function from Microsoft, Bing, &quot;How do I write a merge sort in JavaScript?&quot;, 2023-08-31</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">mergeSort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">array</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you use LLMs <strong>you must cite it</strong>, but it's probably better to Google what it tells you and find a real citation because:</p>
<p><strong>LLMs like ChatGPT are wrong a lot.</strong> It does not understand computer science. It understands how to form sentences and paragraphs well enough to be convincing, but it doesn't actually understand what anything it is saying <strong>means.</strong> When it has the choice between two answers, with opposite meanings, it will pick the answer that looks more like things it has seen before, <strong>not</strong> the answer that is more <strong>correct.</strong> This means you need to double-check that what it tells you is actually correct.</p>
<p><strong>StackOverflow is always a better resource than Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard/Gemini, etc.</strong>, but of course if you use code from Stackoverflow or any other website, <strong>you must cite it.</strong> This is because other human programmers will usually check and downvote, remove, or fix bad information on StackOverflow. No one is checking the output of LLMs: if an LLM lies to you, no one will ever know.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and similar services are recording everything you tell it, and tracking you.
Using ChatGPT/Bing/Bard etc. they are recording everything you say and how the LLM responds
to you. There is no privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT example from CMPUT 229:<ul>
<li>Me: "What is the difference between the b and j pseudoinstruction in RISC-V?"</li>
<li>ChatGPT: "... The b instruction is actually a shorthand for the more general beq (branch if equal) instruction, which compares two registers and branches if they are equal. However, &gt; &gt; in the case of b, one of the registers is always x0 (the zero register), so the comparison &gt; is always false, effectively causing an unconditional jump. ...the key difference between b &gt; and j is that b is a relative branch instruction that jumps to a location within a limited range, while j is an absolute jump instruction that can jump to any address within the range of the program counter."</li>
<li>There are 3 problems with this answer:<ol>
<li>b is not shorthand for beq: RARS replaces it with jal -- the actual replacement depends on the assembler used and the situation it is used in.</li>
<li>This also makes ChatGPT's conclusion about relative limited range jumps and absolute jumps wrong. All jumps and branches in RISC-V are relative, short range jumps except jalr. RARS also (at least in every case I've seen) translates j to jal, not jalr, and jal is also a short-range, relative jump.</li>
<li>If b gets translated to beq x0, Y, label then what guarantees that the other register isn't also zero? The comparison with beq x0, Y cannot always be false, despite what ChatGPT claimed. This really doesn't make any sense. It would make more sense for it to be translated to bne x0, x0, label   ... but that's the opposite instruction of what ChatGPT claimed.</li>

<h4 id="re-evaluation-of-term-work">Re-Evaluation of Term Work</h4>
<p>Re-Evaluation of Term Work follows the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/resources/policy-information/department-course-policies.html">Computing Science department course policies</a>. Any questions or concerns about marks on a particular assignment must be brought to the attention of the instructor <em>(not a TA)</em> within 10 calendar days of its return date. After that, we will not consider remarking or re-evaluating the work. So do not expect anyone to re-evaluate all the work you did all term long in the hopes of getting a higher final grade.</p>
<p>However, clerical errors such as incorrectly computing or recording a mark may be raised at any time prior to 2 working days following the final exam. It is the student's responsibility to confirm that their term work has been recorded properly.</p>
<h4 id="re-examination">Re-examination</h4>
<p>This course is not eligible for re-examination.</p>
<h4 id="past-or-representative-evaluative-material">Past or Representative Evaluative Material</h4>
<p>Will be provided. Some of it includes answer keys, most exam material does not include an answer key.</p>
<p>As of this writing, we are currently in the process of moving this material off of eClass to make it available. We plan to have it available by Week 10 on the course website. However, we may make it available on eClass instead, depending on how well the move is going.</p>
<h3 id="policies-for-late-and-missed-work">Policies for Late and Missed Work</h3>
<h4 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h4>
<p>Absolutely no late work will be accepted. No extensions will be granted to individual students for any reason.</p>
<h4 id="missed-term-work">Missed Term Work</h4>
<p><strong>Missed Term Work or Final Exam Due to Non-medical Protected Grounds (e.g., religious beliefs):</strong><br>
When a term assessment or final exam presents a conflict based on <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/eligibility.html">non-medical protected grounds</a>, students must apply to the Academic Success Centre for accommodations via their <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-success-centre/accessibility-resources/register/index.html">Register for Accommodations website</a>. Students can review their eligibility and choose the application process specific for <em>Accommodations Based on Non-medical Protected Grounds</em>. </p>
<p>It is imperative that students review the dates of all course assessments upon receipt of the course syllabus, and apply <strong><em>AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</em></strong> to ensure the timely application of the accommodation. Students who apply later in the term may experience unavoidable delays in the processing of the application, which can affect the accommodation.  </p>
<h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>
<p>Labs are due Friday at 4PM on the same week the lab was presented. Project meetings are due at the time of the meeting, and they are included in the lab mark. Failure to attend and actively participate in project meetings will result in a lab mark of zero.</p>
<p>The 2 lowest marks for Labs (including project meetings) will be dropped when calculating the course mark. 
No late labs will be accepted.
Failure to complete a lab (or to attend project a project meeting) on time for any reason will result in a mark of zero.
Please note that you can miss 2 labs (or project meetings) without penalty.</p>
<h4 id="lecture-participation">Lecture Participation</h4>
<p>Participation exercises will be available most lectures.</p>
<p>The 6 lowest marks for lecture participation will be dropped when calculating the course mark. 
No late participation will be accepted.
Failure to complete a participation exercise on time for any reason will result in a mark of zero.
Please note that you can miss 6 lectures without penalty.</p>
<p>Submitting a participation exercise or mentimeter without attending the lecture will be considered a breach of the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
<h4 id="assignments-and-project-parts">Assignments and Project Parts</h4>
<p>A student who cannot complete an assignment or contribute to a project part due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction or other compelling reasons must contact the instructor <strong>within two working days</strong> of missing the assessment, or as soon as possible, to request an excused absence. If an excused absence is granted, then weight will be transferred to the final exam. An excused absence is a privilege and not a right. There is no guarantee that an absence will be excused. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused absence is a serious breach of the Student Academic Integrity Policy. In all cases, instructors may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason for the absence at their discretion.</p>
<p>Failure to complete an assignment or contribute to a project part without an excused absence will result in a raw score of zero or a proportional score reduction.</p>
<h4 id="deferred-final-examination">Deferred Final Examination</h4>
<p>A student who cannot write the final examination due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction or other compelling reasons can apply for a deferred final examination. Such an application must be made to the student’s Faculty office within two working days of the missed examination and must be supported by appropriate documentation or a Statutory Declaration (see calendar on <a href="https://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=44\&amp;navoid=13550#attendance">Attendance</a>). Deferred examinations are a privilege and not a right; there is no guarantee that a deferred examination will be granted. The Faculty may deny deferral requests in cases where less than 50% of term work has been completed. Misrepresentation of facts to gain a deferred examination is a serious breach of the Student Academic Integrity Policy. </p>

<h4 id="academic-integrity-and-student-conduct">Academic Integrity and Student Conduct</h4>
<p>The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty, as well as maintaining a learning environment that fosters the safety, security, and the inherent dignity of each member of the community, ensuring students conduct themselves accordingly. Students are expected to be familiar with the standards of academic honesty and appropriate student conduct, and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect. </p>
<p>Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a> and the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Conduct Policy</a>, and avoid any behaviour that could potentially result in suspicions of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts, participation in an offence) and non-academic misconduct (e.g., discrimination, harassment, physical assault). Academic and non-academic misconduct are taken very seriously and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University.</p>
<p>All students are expected to consult the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/academic-resources/academic-integrity">Academic Integrity website</a> for clarification on the various academic offences. All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the University. Unfamiliarity of the rules, procrastination or personal pressures are not acceptable excuses for committing an offence. Listen to your instructor, be a good person, ask for help when you need it, and do your own work -- this will lead you toward a path to success. Any academic integrity concern in this course will be reported to the College of Natural and Applied Sciences. Suspected cases of non-academic misconduct will be reported to the Dean of Students. The College, the Faculty, and the Dean of Students are committed to student rights and responsibilities, and adhere to due process and administrative fairness, as outlined in the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a> and the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Conduct Policy</a>. Please refer to the policy websites for details on inappropriate behaviours and possible sanctions.</p>
<p>The College of Natural and Applied Sciences (CNAS) has created an <a href="https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=88399">Academic Integrity for CNAS Students</a> eClass site. Students can self enroll and review the various resources provided, including the importance of academic integrity, examples of academic misconduct &amp; possible sanctions, and the academic misconduct &amp; appeal process. They can also complete assessments to test their knowledge and earn a completion certificate.</p>

<h4 id="contract-cheating-and-misuse-of-university-academic-materials-or-other-assets">Contract Cheating and Misuse of University Academic Materials or Other Assets</h4>
<p>Contract cheating describes the form of academic dishonesty where students get academic work completed on their behalf, which they then submit for academic credit as if they had created it themselves.</p>
<p>Contract cheating may or may not involve the payment of a fee to a third party, who then creates the work for the student.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting someone to write an essay or research paper for you.</li>
<li>Getting someone to complete your assignment or exam for you.</li>
<li>Posting an essay, assignment or exam question to a tutorial or study website; the question is answered by a “content expert”, then you copy it and submit it as your own answer.</li>
<li>Posting your solutions to a tutorial/study website, public server or group chat and/or copying solutions that were posted to a tutorial/study website public server or group chat.</li>
<li>Sharing your login credentials to the course management system (e.g. eClass) and allowing someone else to complete your assignment or exam remotely.</li>
<li>Using an artificial intelligence bot or text generator tool to complete your essay, research paper, assignment or exam solutions for you (without the instructor’s permission).</li>
<li>Using an online grammar checker to “fix” your essay, research paper, assignment or exam solutions for you (without the instructor’s permission).</li>
</ol>
<p>Contract cheating companies thrive on making students believe that they cannot succeed without their help; they attempt to convince students that cheating is the only way to succeed.</p>
<p>Uploading the instructor’s teaching materials (e.g. course outlines, lecture slides, assignment or exam questions, etc.) to tutorial, study or note-sharing websites or public servers is a copyright infringement and constitutes the misuse of University academic materials or other assets.</p>
<p>Receiving assignment solutions or answers to exam questions from an unauthorised source puts you at risk of receiving inaccurate information.</p>
<h5 id="academic-integrity-issues-related-to-minor-formative-assessments">Academic Integrity Issues Related to Minor Formative Assessments</h5>
<p>In order to reduce the burden of discipline cases on the Faculty of Science Decision Makers, and to provide feedback to students in a more timely fashion, the following Faculty of Science policy may be followed:</p>
<p>The instructor may assign a full or partial deduction along with a standardized letter notifying the student of a first offence on a minor assessment (e.g. assignment or lab) worth no more than 5% where a substantial portion of the work is found to be not unique.</p>
<p>Subsequent offences on minor assessments, and ALL suspected academic misconduct on formative assessments (e.g. quizzes, exams, assessments worth more than 5%), will be reported to the Faculty of Science as a possible breach of the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193\&amp;s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx">Student Academic Integrity Policy</a> following the usual process.</p>
<h4 id="appropriate-collaboration">Appropriate Collaboration</h4>
<h5 id="general">General</h5>
<p>Appropriate collaboration follows the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/resources/policy-information/department-course-policies.html">CS course policy</a>. See the above table under <a href="#grade-evaluation">Grade Evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>Students need to be able to recognize when they’ve crossed the line between appropriate collaboration and inappropriate collaboration. If students are unsure, they need to ask the instructors to clarify what’s allowed and what’s not allowed. </p>
<p>Here are some tips to avoid copying on assessments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not write down something that you cannot explain to your instructor.</li>
<li>When you are helping other students, avoid showing them your work directly. Instead, explain your solution verbally. Allowing your work to be copied is also considered inappropriate collaboration.</li>
<li>It is possible that verbally discussing the solution in too much detail may result in written responses that are too similar. Try to keep discussions at a general or high level.</li>
<li>If you find yourself reading another student's solution, do not write anything down. Once you understand how to solve the problem, remove the other person's work from your sight and then write up the solution to the question yourself. Looking back and forth between someone else's paper and your own paper is almost certainly copying and considered inappropriate collaboration.</li>
<li>If the instructor or TA writes down part of a solution in order to help explain it to you or the class, you cannot copy it and hand it in for credit. Treat it the same way you would treat another student's work with respect to copying, that is, remove the explanation from your sight and then write up the solution yourself.</li>
<li>There is often more than one way to solve a problem. Choose the method that makes the most sense to you rather than the method that other students happen to use. If none of the ideas in your solution are your own, there is a good chance it will be flagged as copying.</li>
</ol>
<p>An additional link that may be useful is "How to Avoid Inappropriate Collaboration": <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/campus-life/academic-success/academic-integrity/collaboration.html">https://www.ualberta.ca/campus-life/academic-success/academic-integrity/collaboration.html</a></p>
<p>For programming assignments software tools are used to detect plagiarism. When the software tools indicate that there is similarity between two submissions, the submissions are reviewed by the instructor or teaching assistant. If the possibility that the standards for academic honesty were violated is confirmed, an investigation is started. Eventually the submitted solutions may be forwarded to the Faculty of Science Associate Dean of Students for further investigation and eventual sanctions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student must be able to verbally describe their exam answers and code, line by line, to a professor or TA, if asked to do so. Your mark may be reduced if you aren't able to explain your own work satisfactorily.</li>
<li>For some substantial programming assignments and homework questions, students may discuss the concepts covered by the assignment with other students registered in the course as long as they do not share actual solutions or programming code.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="citation">Citation</h5>
<p>If you include code or ideas from someone who isn't you (including from an Generative AI or LLM) you must cite it. Here is an example of an appropriate citation:</p>

<h5 id="solo-effort">Solo Effort</h5>
<ul>
<li>Participation Exercises (unless otherwise announced during lecture)</li>
</ul>
<p>Participation exercises fall under the departments <em>Solo Effort</em> model unless announced by the instructor. <em>Solo Effort</em> must be completed by the student registered in the course without external assistance from any individual or organization. <em>Students may only submit work authored by themselves.</em></p>
<h6 id="exams">Exams</h6>
<p>Midterm and Final Exams are confidential and <em>Solo Effort</em>. No discussion of the contents of the exam is permitted except with instructors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each student must be able to verbally describe their exam answers and code, line by line, to a professor or TA, if asked to do so. Your mark may be reduced if you aren't able to explain your own work satisfactorily.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="consultation">Consultation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Assignments</li>
<li>Labs</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignments and Labs are under the department's <em>Consultation</em> model. That means you may discuss the labs with others, but you must write up the solution on your own. If you consult with other students, you must list their names in a comment at the top of your submission, along with a brief description of the part(s) of the assignment you discussed.  All sources used must be cited. Moreover, each student is responsible for what is handed-in and must be able to explain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consultation - you can talk to anyone else, but you must submit your own code, and acknowledge who you talked to. All sources used must be cited.<ul>
<li>You can freely discuss the concepts and solutions with your 175 classmates on an informal verbal level.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> exchange any written text, code, or detailed step-by-step procedures.</li>
<li>Limit discussion to be among students taking the current 175 course, not students who took 175 in earlier terms or other students. Consultation is a two-way process that benefits both sides.</li>
<li>Individually develop your own solution for assignments and exercises. <strong>Submit only your own work for evaluation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> give other students access to your solutions and do not seek access to other's solutions. This is considered plagiarism.<ul>
<li>Do not show your code to classmates.</li>
<li>Do not look at a classmate's code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All sources of information used, e.g., books, websites, students you talked to etc., must be cited in your submitted file for each assignment. If student A cites student B, then B should also cite A as consulted.</li>
<li>Study the Computing Science policy regarding Academic Integrity, Collaboration Policy and Plagiarism and make sure that you are familiar with the definition of plagiarism and cheating in the Code of Student Behaviour.</li>
<li>We will use powerful automated tools to compare submitted work from current as well as previous courses and flag potential cases of plagiarism.</li>
<li>All suspected cases of plagiarism will be forwarded to the Dean's office and thoroughly investigated. Receiving a low mark for work not completed is a far superior alternative to this process and its possible long-term consequences for your career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each student must be able to verbally describe their exam answers and code, line by line, to a professor or TA, if asked to do so. Your mark may be reduced if you aren't able to explain your own work satisfactorily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may only submit work authored by themselves, or with approved co-authors. Work submitted by a student that is the work of someone else (e.g. another student or a tutor) either in part or in entirety is considered plagiarism. Cases of plagiarism and other forms of cheating are immediately referred to the Dean of Science, who determines what course of action is appropriate. We do not hesitate to send ALL cases of cheating to the Dean's office. Please do not put yourself or us into such an unpleasant situation. Please read the Code of Student Behavior carefully. </p>
<p>Examples of collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceptable collaboration example:<ul>
<li>Student A has a problem with the code</li>
<li>Student A asks Student B for help</li>
<li>Student B assists Student A to fix the code</li>
<li>Student A understands the fix</li>
<li>Student A can reproduce and explain the fix.</li>
<li>Student A submits the code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptable collaboration example:<ul>
<li>Student A has a problem with the code</li>
<li>Student A asks Student B for help</li>
<li>Student B provides Student A with small snippet of code and explains it</li>
<li>Student A understands the code and integrates it with his/her code</li>
<li>Student A references Student B as a comment in the code</li>
<li>Student A submits the code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unacceptable</strong> collaboration example:<ul>
<li>Student A has a problem with the code</li>
<li>Student A asks Student B for help</li>
<li>Student B provides Student A with the code</li>
<li>Student A submits the code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For some substantial programming assignments and homework questions, students may discuss the concepts covered by the assignment with other students registered in the course as long as they do not share actual solutions or programming code.</p>
<h5 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h5>
<ul>
<li>Project</li>
<li>Some participation exercises (only when announced by the instructor during lecture)</li>
</ul>
<p>The semester project falls under the department's <em>Teamwork</em> model.</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as you are a part of a group, you are responsible for everything in the group project, whether or not you participated in every component.</li>
<li>A group may only submit work authored by group members or appropriately cited and credited code that does not violate the author's license.</li>
<li>Modifying, removing, or forging <code>git</code> history will be considered an academic integrity violation.</li>
<li>Bullying or hassment of team members will be brought to the Dean of Students under the Student Conduct Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="intellectual-violence">Intellectual Violence</h5>
<p>In this course, <em>Intellectual Violence</em> is considered bullying. Intellectual violence is when one teammate uses their skill, knowledge, or experience, to intimidate or control the other teammate(s) rather than sharing and helping them learn. Examples of <em>Intellectual Violence</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Using complex terminology or concepts to make others feel inferior.</li>
