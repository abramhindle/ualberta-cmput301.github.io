1. Draw the UML Class diagram for
   commands that you expect would
   exist inside of a text editor.
2. Give example code of how you
   would fill in the CutMenuListener's
   void menuAction() Method of the
   Edit Menu's "Cut MenuItem"

```
class CutMenuListener {
// this is called when the Cut menu item in the Edit Menu
// is clicked or the key combo ctrl-X is pressed.
    public void menuAction() {

    }
}
```
Submit your drawing as a PNG file.
