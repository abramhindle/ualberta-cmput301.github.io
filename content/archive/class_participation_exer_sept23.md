**Class Participation Exercise Sept 23**

Based on the Java code, design a UML class diagram that represents the structure of this these classes. Pay special attention to the relationships and their multiplicities (the 1 or 0..* or 1..* etc.).

Add your name and your partner's name (if you have one) to the diagram.
<br>

Upload a screenshot. If you worked in a pair, get the screenshot from your partner and upload the same screenshot.
<br>

You can screenshot a diagrammer of your choice, or draw it on paper and take a photo.

Do not change file extension without converting in a conversion application, you will make the file unreadable by eclass and get a zero. **For example, renaming a file from .heif or .heic to .png will make it unreadable and you will get a zero.** Instead, open it in a conversion tool like preview and export it as a different file format.

Here's a handy diagrammer online: https://app.diagrams.net/ IF that one doesn't work for you, try a different one. I use umlet personally, which you have to download and install. https://www.umlet.com/

Here's the Java code:
