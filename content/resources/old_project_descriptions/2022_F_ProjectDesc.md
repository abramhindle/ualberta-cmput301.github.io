# Project Problem Description

You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the follow goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow future developers to extend or migrate it.

To assist in meal planning, we want a mobile application that allows one to track their food storage, record their recipes, plan their meals for several days, and prepare shopping lists.

**Needs in (Partial) User Story Form**

User needs are expressed in the form of partial user stories:
