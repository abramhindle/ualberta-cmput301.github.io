Use Case

Write a use case for the task of a young person applying for a job based on the following scenario.

I open up the JobRoulette app. The app asks me to provide demographic information including my name and age. Then it asks about education, which I describe my high school diploma and 1 bachelor's degree in actuarial sciences from the University of Waterloo. After that it provides me with a list of 4 categories of skills, I click on IT skills. It provides a list of technologies and asks me to click on ones I am familiar with, I click MS Office, Excel, and Raid Shadow Legends. I submit those skills and the app shows me 3 brief job descriptions. I click on one, it shows me details, and I’m not interested so I click decline. I click on the next one “VPN promoter”. Based on the details it seems to be relevant to my interests and so I click apply. The app tells me that it has submitted my application.
