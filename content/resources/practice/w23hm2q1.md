**I want to track my tea collection. I collect tea. I use TeaBox app to track my tea and to make trades of tea with other users: I propose a trade and if the other player accepts then we email each other. Some teas cannot be consumed if they are too old, so I need to be warned when tea in my collection needs to be consumed. Some teas are meant to age and I donâ€™t need warnings but I need to know their age. When I completely consume a tea, it should be removed from the active collection into the archived collection, as I would like to keep a record of past teas.**
